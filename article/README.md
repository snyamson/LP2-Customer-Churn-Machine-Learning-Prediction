# Unlocking Insights: Decoding Telecommunication Customer Churn Through Machine Learning

# Introduction
In the dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of the telecommunications industry, customer churn has become a critical challenge for service providers. The ability to predict and understand customer churn can significantly impact business success, customer retention strategies, and ultimately, the bottom line. 
In this project, we embark on an exciting journey to explore and analyze customer churn within the Vodafone network service using the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework. 
Our aim is to leverage data-driven insights to identify key factors influencing churn, build predictive models, and develop actionable recommendations that can help Vodafone proactively retain valuable customers and enhance their overall service offerings.

# Data Loading
In this project, I navigate through a dataset dispersed across three distinct sources, harnessing each for valuable insights.

The initial segment, spanning the first 3000 records, resides within a remote database. I access this data remotely using the pyodc library.

The second 2000 records await in OneDrive, with the name "Telco-churn-second-2000.xlsx." This file serves as our test dataset, an essential piece in evaluating our analysis.

Lastly, the GitHub repository houses the final component â€“ "LP2_Telco-churn-last-2000.csv."
