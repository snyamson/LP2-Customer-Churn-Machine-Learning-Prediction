In the dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of the telecommunications industry, customer churn has become a critical challenge for service providers. The ability to predict and understand customer churn can significantly impact business success, customer retention strategies and increase customer service satisfaction.

## Project Overview

This project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework to explore and analyze customer churn within the Vodafone network service. The aim is to leverage data-driven insights to identify key factors influencing churn, build predictive models, and develop actionable recommendations that can help Vodafone proactively retain valuable customers and enhance their overall service offerings.

## Summary

| Code      | Name        | Published Article |  Deployed App |
|-----------|-------------|:-------------:|------:|
| LP 2      | Customer Churn Classification Prediction |  [Read Article](https://your-article-link) | [View Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOWE0MGNhMDgtMDdmYS00ZTVmLWJjY2MtNGRjNzVkZDlhMmM2IiwidCI6IjQ0ODdiNTJmLWYxMTgtNDgzMC1iNDlkLTNjMjk4Y2I3MTA3NSJ9) |

## Hypothesis Investigated
**Null Hypothesis (H0)** :The monthly subscription cost (MonthlyCharges) has no significant effect on customer churn (Churn) from the Vodafone network service.

**Alternate Hypothesis (H1)** : The monthly subscription cost (MonthlyCharges) has a significant effect on customer churn (Churn) from the Vodafone network service.

### Results
|Test Conducted | T-Statistic | P-Value |
| --------------| --------------- | ---------| 
| Independent Samples T - Test | 14.650610568422312 | 1.2575465113545793e-47 | 

The statistical analysis yielded a calculated statistic of `14.65`, accompanied by a remarkably low p-value of approximately `1.26e-47`.  With this statistical outcome, we confidently reject the null hypothesis and conclude that Monthly Charges exert a substantial influence on customer churn. The p-value indicates that the observed relationship between Monthly Charges and churn is highly unlikely to occur by chance, reinforcing the robustness of our findings.

## Model Selection

![model per](https://github.com/snyamson/LP2-Customer-Churn-Machine-Learning-Prediction/assets/58486437/f5522617-3f6f-4239-9a39-694cc6aac32d)
The `Random Forest Classifier` stands out as the best-performing model due to its highest accuracy among the evaluated models `(85.48%)`. As accuracy is a key performance metric for our project, selecting the Random Forest Classifier ensures that we prioritize correctly predicting customer churn in our future predictions on the test dataset.
