# Customer Churn Prediction Project

In the dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of the telecommunications industry, customer churn has become a critical challenge for service providers. The ability to predict and understand customer churn can significantly impact business success, customer retention strategies, and ultimately, the bottom line.

In this project, we embark on an exciting journey to explore and analyze customer churn within the Vodafone network service using the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework. Our aim is to leverage data-driven insights to identify key factors influencing churn, build predictive models, and develop actionable recommendations that can help Vodafone proactively retain valuable customers and enhance their overall service offerings.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn within the Vodafone network service. By analyzing historical customer data, we aim to develop predictive models that can identify potential churners and provide insights into the factors influencing customer decisions. The project follows the CRISP-DM framework, encompassing data understanding, data preparation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
